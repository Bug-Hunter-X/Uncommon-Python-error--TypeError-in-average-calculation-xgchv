# Uncommon Python Error: TypeError in Average Calculation

This repository demonstrates a subtle error that can occur when calculating the average of a list in Python.  The code attempts to calculate the average of a list but doesn't properly handle cases where the input list is empty or contains non-numeric elements.  This leads to a `TypeError` during execution.

The `bug.py` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.py` shows how to fix this with error handling and type checking.
